# 2 Wall 2 Taker

Simple [Walltaker](https://walltaker.joi.how) client for Windows and Linux.

Only con: no video support

## Usage

- [Download](https://github.com/dogkisser/2wall2taker/releases) and run
- Click on the tray icon (in American markets the icon is an eggplant, in Europe it's an aubergine) and open the Settings
- Enter your Walltaker link ID(s) and Save
- Optionally Refresh to update your wallpaper initially

## Issues

- If communication with Walltaker fails (Walltaker goes down, network issues),
    it crashes.
- I think maybe keeping a dialog open too long will drop the websocket lol
