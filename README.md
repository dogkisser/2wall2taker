# 2 Wall 2 Taker

Simple [Walltaker](https://walltaker.joi.how) client for [Windows, Linux].

Only con: no video support

## Issues

- If communication with Walltaker fails (Walltaker goes down, network issues),
    it crashes.
- I think maybe keeping a dialog open too long will drop the websocket lol
